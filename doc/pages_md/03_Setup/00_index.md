Alambic can be installed on any GNU/Linux system supporting Perl, see:

* the [prerequisites](/Setup/Prequisites),
* how to [install Alambic on a server](/Setup/Install),
* how to [run Alambic](/Setup/Run),
* and when required how to [upgrade an Alambic instance](/Setup/Upgrade).

There is also a docker image to run the application in a breeze, see the [Docker](/Setup/Docker) section.
