Alambic can be installed on any GNU/Linux system supporting Perl, see:

* the [prerequisites](/Setup/Prerequisites.html),
* how to [install Alambic on a server](/Setup/Install.html),
* how to [run Alambic](/Setup/Run.html),
* and when required how to [upgrade an Alambic instance](/Setup/Upgrade.html).

There is also a docker image to run the application in a breeze, see the [Docker](/Setup/Docker.html) section.
