# Building external dashboards

Alambic has an interesting feature that enables users to [re-use generated content](/Documentation/Basics/Exports.html) on external web sites. It notably enable users to build their own dashboards in external tools like Atlassian Confluence, Liferay or basically any external web site that can embed external html snippets and/or pictures.

The complete list of plots that can be exported for a project is listed in the instance's documentation (Documentation > Data) and in the project&apos;s data page.

This page provides guidelines to setup an external dashbaord re-using Alambic information, with practical examples on a Confluence wiki.
