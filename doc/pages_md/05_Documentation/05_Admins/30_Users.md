# Admin > Users

This section displays information about users defined in Alambic.

![Alambic Admin Web UI](/images/admins_users.png)

Administrators can add, edit or delete users. Information required for users is the following:

* A unique user ID
* Complete name
* Email address
* Password
* Roles: Admin, Project, Guest

Note that the email address is then used to build the user's profile -- see the [documentation on profiles](/Documentation/Users/MyAlambic.html).
