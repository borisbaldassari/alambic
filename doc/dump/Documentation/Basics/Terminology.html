<h1>Terminology</h1>

<h2>Quality attributes</h2>

<p><strong>Quality attributes</strong> represent features of quality you want to achieve, like maintainability (for product) or activity (for community). It is defined on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Attributes also have a confidence interval (e.g. 5/7) that shows how many metrics were actually used to compute it, compared to the total number of metrics that should have been used (in the case of missing metrics).</p>

<p>Since everybody has a different meaning for such characteristics, it is vital to precisely define them to setup a semantic foundation for all participants. It is a good idea to rely on existing models for these definitions, like ISO 9126 or ISO 250xx.</p>

<p>The complete list of attributes for an Alambic instance is self-documented on the instance itself, in the Documentation > Attributes section. En example can be found on one of the demonstration instances, e.g. <a href="http://eclipse.castalia.camp/documentation/attributes.html">eclipse.alambic.io</a>.</p>

<p>In Alambic attributes are defined through an ID, a name, and a description. See <a href="/Documentation/Admins/Models.html">Admins > Models</a> for more details about the JSON format.</p>

<h2>Indicators</h2>

<p>Indicators range from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent). They are entirely subjective, since they will vary depending on the project's context and on people's understanding of what is good or not. In other words they are a localised judgement on the raw numbers collected from the data sources.</p>

<p>Indicators are computed from metrics using the scales.</p>

<h2>Scales</h2>

<p>Scales define what is bad, good or excellent regarding the collected numbers. They are a way of <em>adapting</em> raw numbers to the local context and give hints about the interpretation of numbers.</p>

<p>Scales provide thresholds, so they are defined as an array of 4 integers as in: <code>[15, 30, 50, 80]</code>. In this case, percentages from 0 to 15% would be classified 1/5, from 16 to 30% would be 2/5, from 31 to 50% would be 3/5, from 51 to 80% would be 4/5, and over 81% would be 5/5.</p>

<p>It should be noted that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different tools may induce a different meaning for the same metric. With Git, having a huge number of branches is considered normal, since most projects use branches to develop new features and fixes. In subversion a similar high number of branches would probably indicate a bad branch management.</li>
<li>Different processes or contexts may also impact scales: some projects try to treat and close bugs as soon as possible while others let them exist for a very long time, until someone simply treat them. Those are different ways of managing issues, none is really wrong, just choose yours and apply sensible limits (i.e. scales).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Metrics</h2>

<p>Metrics are the base measures used to assess the quality model. Examples of metrics include <code>Number of emails sent on the developer mailing list during last week</code> or <code>Number of commits during last week</code>.</p>

<p>The complete list of metrics for an Alambic instance is self-documented on the instance itself, in the Documentation > Metrics section. En example can be found on one of the demonstration instances, e.g. <a href="http://eclipse.castalia.camp/documentation/metrics.html">eclipse.alambic.io</a>.</p>

<p>In Alambic metrics are defined through an ID, a name, description, and an associated scale. See <a href="/Documentation/Admins/Models.html">Admins > Models</a> for more details about the JSON format.</p>
