Alambic
=======

Alambic is a quality management framework for software projects. 

It basically retrieves metrics from many various repositories (code metrics, scm, its, mailing lists, etc.) and aggregates them in a tree-like custom quality model. The [quality model](https://bitbucket.org/BorisBaldassari/alambic/wiki/QualityModel) can be customised, and almost any type of data source can be added through plugins. 

Alambic is most notably used by (and is actually derived from) the [PolarSys dashboard](http://dashboard.polarsys.org).

# Alambic main features

* Retrieves data from any source, aggregates and displays them in a custom dashboard.
* Alambic is entirely Web-based, althought it is very easy to understand how files are organised. 
* Plugins are used to add new data sources, and visualisation units.
* Custom Data plugins allow to enter manual data (e.g. surveys) and compute custom metrics from them.
